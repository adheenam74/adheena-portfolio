# Fraud Risk Analysis (Excel Project)

This project is a simulated fraud analytics case study created using Microsoft Excel.  
It demonstrates how to identify suspicious financial transactions using fraud flags, risk scoring, and pivot-based analysis.

## Overview

The dataset contains simulated card transaction records.  
The objective is to detect unusual or potentially fraudulent behavior by:

- Creating fraud indicator flags  
- Building a weighted risk score  
- Applying conditional formatting to highlight risky transactions  
- Summarizing patterns using PivotTables and PivotCharts  
- Presenting insights in a clean overview sheet

## Transparency

This project was created by **Adheena M** as a simulated portfolio project.  
ChatGPT was used only for conceptual guidance and instructions.  
All analysis, formulas, pivots, charts, and interpretations were done manually.


This project is part of my learning and portfolio development.
